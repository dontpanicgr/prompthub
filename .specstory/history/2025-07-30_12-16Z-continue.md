_**Assistant**_

I can see you're working on a PromptHunt project (a UGC platform for AI prompts) and you're currently looking at a SpecStory artifacts directory file. However, I need more context about what you'd like me to continue with.

Let me explore your workspace to understand the current state of your project: It looks like your PromptHunt project workspace is currently empty except for the SpecStory directory. Based on your coding instructions, I can see this is meant to be a comprehensive UGC platform for AI prompts with:

- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth + PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+ with App Router
- **UI**: Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Development phases**: User Roles → Personal CRUD → Browse & Discovery → UX/UI Enhancements

Would you like me to help you:

1. **Set up the initial Next.js project structure** with Supabase integration?
2. **Continue from a specific phase** of your development plan?
3. **Implement a specific feature** you were working on?
4. **Set up the database schema** for prompts and user roles?

Please let me know what aspect you'd like to continue with, and I'll help you build out your PromptHunt platform according to your specifications!
